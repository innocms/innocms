## Installation Instructions
### 1. Choose a PHP Environment:
You can choose from integrated environments such as Xiaopi, Baota, XAMPP, etc., which are very convenient. If you prefer customization, compiling and installing PHP yourself is also great.

Version requirements: PHP: `8.2` or above, MySQL: `5.7` or `8.0`

### 2. Set the Website Root Directory:
Next, let's point your website's root directory to the current project's `public` folder and configure the pseudo-static settings so that when you visit the website, you can directly see our content.

### 3. Install Third-Party Dependencies:
Open the command-line tool, navigate to your current project directory, and then enter `composer install`. This will help us install the required third-party packages.

### 4. Create a Configuration File:
Copy a configuration file as a starting point by running the following command: `cp .env.example .env`. This way, you will have an initial configuration file.

### 5. Configure the Database:
Open the `.env` file, find the lines starting with `DB_`, and fill in your database configuration information.

### 6. Generate a System Key:
Run the following command to generate a secure key for the system: `php artisan key:generate`

### 7. Database Migration and Data Seeding:
Execute the following command to create the database structure and import the basic data: `php artisan migrate && php artisan db:seed`

### 8. Upload Resource Directory Settings:
Run the following command to create the upload resource directory: `php artisan storage:link`

### 9. Frontend Resource Compilation:
Finally, run the following command to compile the frontend's CSS and JavaScript files: `npm install && npm run prod`

### 10. Log in to the Website Backend for Configuration:

To access your website's backend, please use your website's specific backend address.

For example, if your website address is `example.com`, then the backend access address is `example.com/panel`.

When logging in, please use your administrator account and password. The initial login credentials are usually:

- Email: admin@innocms.com
- Password: 123456

After entering your login information, you can enter the backend for configuration.

We wish you a smooth installation process. If you have any questions or difficulties during installation or use, please feel free to join our QQ communication group, the group number is: 960062283

Our team and enthusiastic users will provide you with real-time help and support.

## Development Instructions
### 1. Independent Release Reminder:
Please note that the three folders under the `/innopacks` directory will be released as independent Composer packages after the v1.0 version is released.

Therefore, we recommend that you avoid directly editing the files in that directory.

### 2. Frontend Development Guide:
If you are developing the frontend for the second time, you can publish the required view files by executing the following command:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="InnoCMS\Front\FrontServiceProvider" --tag=views
```

After this operation, the system will automatically generate the corresponding template files for you in the `/resources/views/vendor` directory.

### 3. Backend Development Guide:
Similarly, backend secondary development can also obtain template files through the following command:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="InnoCMS\Panel\PanelServiceProvider" --tag=views
```

After executing the command, you will find the template files required for the backend in the same directory.

### 4. Invitation to Free Play:
Now, you can boldly develop and customize in this safe environment without worrying about damaging the original code.

### 5. Error Correction Tips:
If you accidentally make a wrong modification, don't worry! Just delete those modified files, and the system will automatically restore to its original state.

### 6. Backend Development:
A plugin development mechanism based on `hook` will be launched soon, allowing you to enjoy a free and flexible customized development experience without touching the core code of the system.

### Please look forward to the innovation and convenience we bring!
- If you find `InnoCMS` helpful to you, please do not hesitate to give us a star.
- Every like from you is the driving force for our continuous improvement.
